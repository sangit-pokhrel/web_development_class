                        <p>Being the best IT college in Nepal, we are an avid follower of education based on practical
                            approach. The college recognizes the fact that in order to be successful in finding a
                            rewarding career, real life skills are also essential. For this reason, classes are held on
                            personality development, presentation skills and public speaking skills. This combination of
                            both academic and real life skills would thus help students towards their holistic
                            development</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            With a view to provide real time work experience right after the completion of the first
                            year, students are provided with internship opportunities with renowned Companies in Nepal.
                            Similarly, after the completion of second year students are placed in various companies in
                            Nepal and abroad in positions according to their skill level.
